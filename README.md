# United States Air Pollution Analysis

## Description
This project, conducted by the "Meaningful Patterns" team as part of the DSC 465 â€“ Data Visualization Winter 2023 course, delves into the air pollution levels in the United States from 2000 to 2016. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, compiled by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we analyze the fluctuations in air quality across various states, focusing on four major pollutants: carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone.

## Dataset
The dataset encompasses hourly, daily, and annual averages of the mentioned pollutants, recorded across over 4,000 monitoring stations nationwide. It covers 47 states, 133 counties, and 144 cities, comprising 1.7 million rows with 28 columns, including categorical, continuous, and geographical variables.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved cleaning and transforming the data for analysis. Steps included removing unnecessary variables, handling null values, and converting AQI readings to maintain consistent units.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Utilized a correlation matrix to understand relationships between pollutants, and QQ plots to assess distributions.
- **Visualizations:** Various visualizations were created using R and Tableau to analyze pollutant distributions and AQI changes over time. This includes waffle plots, violin plots, line graphs, choropleths, and hex tile cartograms.
- **Findings:** The analysis revealed carbon monoxide as the most prevalent greenhouse gas, with nitrogen dioxide and ozone significantly impacting air quality. Sulfur dioxide, despite its lower concentration, poses a severe threat due to its toxicity and potential to form acid rain.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with insights on air pollution trends in the U.S., highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and effective strategies to improve air quality.
